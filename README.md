# Learning Flogo on Katacoda

_These scenarios are no longer maintained. If you want to learn Flogo in a fun way, check out the [Flogo Labs](https://tibcosoftware.github.io/flogo/labs/)_

## Because cats and birds can totally be friends!

These are the scenarios that can be found on Katacoda to learn different aspects of [Project Flogo](http://flogo.io)

## Courses
These scenarios will walk you through some basic steps of getting to know Project Flogo. Throughout the scenarios we'll use almost the same app in each occasion to make it easy to follow along either on the Katacoda platform or on your own. In the scenarios you'll build an app that logs a "Hello World" statement and returns that to the invoking app as well.
