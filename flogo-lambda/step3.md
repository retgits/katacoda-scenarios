In this step we'll construct the source code for the Flogo app from the flogo.json as well as create the app!

To create the source code simply execute `flogo create -f flogo.json myapp`{{execute}}. This tells the flogo cli to take the flogo.json file and create the source for the app in a folder called `myapp`. It will also download a few Go packages that the app will need.

The next step is to build the executable and for that we need to be in the directory `myapp` (`cd myapp`{{execute}}). To build a flogo app from the source that you can run on AWS Lambda we'll need to execute a command that is very similar to the one we had in the [cli tutorial](https://www.katacoda.com/retgits/scenarios/flogo-cli), but with some added parameters. The command you need to run is `flogo build -e -shim start_flow_as_a_function_in_lambda`{{execute}}, which tells the flogo cli to build the app as an embedded application (the -e option) and with a target shim (the -shim option which uses the trigger id). The AWS Lambda trigger leverages a makefile to kick off the build process, which simply builds your Flogo application using the Lambda trigger shim and zips the binary for deployment to AWS Lambda.

Once this command finishes successfully the zip file (handler.zip) will be in the `src` directory (`/home/scrapbook/tutorial/myapp/src/myapp`).
