Serverless is all around us and perhaps the fastest growing market for compute. Flogo has first class support for AWS Lambda. So you can infinitely scale your ultralight functions and scale back to zero when not in use with AWS Lambda’s NoOps and seamless scaling capabilities.

We’ll guide you through the set of steps required to build the most basic of functions for deployment to AWS Lambda. The flow you’ll build will be the function you deploy.

_Note that you will need an AWS account for this tutorial_
