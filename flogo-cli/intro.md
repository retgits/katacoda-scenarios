Project Flogo provides two different command-line interfaces and which you need depends on the task you need to execute.

* flogo: This CLI gives you the ability to build flows and microservices. With this tool you can, among other things, create your applications, build applications and install new extensions. This tool is great to use with Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment tools like Jenkins and Travis-CI.
* flogogen: If youâ€™re looking to extend the functionality that Project Flogo offers out of the box, this is the tool you want to use. Flogogen generates the scafolding used by extensions (activity/trigger) developers to build new extensions.

In this tutorial you will learn how to use the first of the two CLI tools
