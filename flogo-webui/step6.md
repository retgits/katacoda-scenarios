Because we do want to send some information back when our service is invoked, we need a flow parameter.

#### Add Flow params
To add a new flow parameter, click on the large grey box called `Flow params`. In the iput section type _name_ in the box where it says _parameter name_ and in the output section type _greeting_ in the box where it says _parameter name_. Click the big blue **save** button to complete this step.
