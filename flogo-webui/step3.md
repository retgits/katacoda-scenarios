Great! So now we have an app, but it won't do anything yet. To make it do something we need flows. Flows represent the logic of our microservice. 

#### A new flow
To create a new flow you can click either the `+ New Flow` button at the top or the `Create a flow` button in the middle of the screen. No matter which you pick, you'll be presented with a dialog to give your new flow a name and an optional description. Click **Create** to create the new flow and click on the newly created flow to open the editor.
