Where flows represent the logic of the service, a trigger gives the flow the option to start. Out of the box Project Flogo comes with a bunch of triggers and if none of them fit your needs, you can either create new ones yourself or look at the [community](https://tibcosoftware.github.io/flogo/showcases/). For now weâ€™ll choose the Receive HTTP Message as the trigger which means our microservice will listen to incoming HTTP messages.
