Activities are the units of work, and those carry out the actual tasks in the flow. Think of them as methods in other programming languages.

#### Add a log activity
You can add activities to the canvas by clicking the `+` button. Let's add a new **Log Message** activity to the service by clicking on the icon and choosing the **Log Message**. By default you'll have a bunch of activities to choose from and just as with triggers, if none of them fit your needs, you can either create new ones yourself or look at the [community](https://tibcosoftware.github.io/flogo/showcases/). The Log activity will give the flow the ability to write data to the standard output. The message parameter is what you want to write to the log, so for now weâ€™ll simply add Hello World

The configuration should be as follows:

* message: `Hello World`
* flowInfo: `True`
* addToFlow: `True`
