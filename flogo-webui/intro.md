In this tutorial you will learn how to use the Project Flogo Web UI and build ultralight microservices.

#### Let's get started!
If you've never heard of Flogo before, you might be wondering what it is. Flogo is

* **_Ultra light_**: Up to 20 to 50 times lighter than Node.js and Java® Dropwizard
* **_built for the Edge_**: Running on devices, as functions and as super small exectables
* **_a Framework_**: Giving you the ability to  use, modify, and contribute to your heart's content

So Flogo is an Ultra light Edge Microservices Framework!

#### Components of Flogo
Flogo has a Web UI, which we'll use in this tutorial as well as two different command-line interfaces and which you need depends on the task you need to execute.

* flogo: This CLI gives you the ability to build flows and microservices.
* flogogen: If you’re looking to extend the functionality that Flogo offers out of the box, this is the tool you want to use.
